# PWM-Generation-using-MCU-AT89C52-in-ASM
A PWM generator code written in ARM assembly for MCU AT89C52

The user is asked the following 3 questions on an LCD and the user inputs using a keypad.
• Frequency of PWM
• Duty cycle
• Wave life (for how long the wave will exist)

Then all the necessary calculations are done and the PWM is sent to pin.
The status of the wave life is also displayed on the LCD.
